## 📌 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Java 17
- **Build Tool:** Maven
- **Frontend:** HTML + Tailwind
- **Cloud Services:**
    - **AWS Lambda** – for serverless compute
    - **Amazon API Gateway** – REST API endpoints
    - **Amazon S3** – Static website
    - **Amazon DynamoDB** – user storage and reminder setup info
    - **Amazon SES** – sends reminder emails
    - **AWS SAM** – infrastructure as code (IaC)

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Set reminders by email, message, time, and day(s)
- 📧 Receive email reminders with quote of the day
- 🕗 Scheduled execution using EventBridge (cron jobs)
- 🗃️ User preferences stored securely in DynamoDB
- 🌐 Static frontend served via S3

## 📖 How It Works

1. User opens the S3-hosted website and enters:
    - Email address
    - Reminder message
    - Time (UTC)
    - Days of the week

2. The form sends a POST request to an API Gateway endpoint which triggers a Lambda function that saves data to DynamoDB.

3. A second Lambda is triggered daily by EventBridge at 8:00 AM UTC(you can specify the time based on your needs). It:
    - Scans DynamoDB
    - Matches users whose reminder time + day match current UTC time
    - Fetches a quote of the day
    - Sends a personalized email via SES

## 🚀 Deployment (via SAM)

> ⚙️ **Pre-requisites**:  
> Make sure you have the **AWS CLI** and **AWS SAM CLI** installed and configured locally with appropriate credentials.

```bash
# 1. Build
sam build

# 2. Deploy
sam deploy --guided

```

## 🧭 Possible Improvements

- Cognito login + user dashboard
- View, edit, and delete existing reminders
- Quote style selector (funny, deep, business)
- Styled unsubscribe footer and branding
